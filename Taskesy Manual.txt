Thank you for using Taskesy!
This is a solo project made entirely by Raúl Velázquez Gómez.

- Main menu bar:

* File:
On the File Menu, you can change various aspects of the application's style; you can change the background color, the color of the boxes, and the menu style of the application (Dark, Light and Classic).
Moreover, you can create new files as well as opening or saving Taskesy files.
Remember that you don't need to save the file with the ".todo" extension; it is automatically done (you can only read and save files with this format).

You can try opening the example file in your Taskesy's download folder, located in the "Example" folder, to see some of the application features.

* Edit Column Names:
You can click on this menu to see all the columns of your Taskesy file.
Click again on the name of an existing column to see a pop-up.
In this pop-up, you will be able to change the name or mark all the boxes of the column as completed (this is a box property that I will discuss later in the manual).
Remember that you can only mark as completed a column with its current rows, if you create a new row and add a box, it won't be marked as completed.

* Exchange Columns:
You can click on this menu to see all the columns of your Taskesy file.
You can click on an existing column; you can then select another column to exchange these columns.
Make sure not to select the same column, because you won't exchange it.

* Add Box:
This is one of the most important options in Taskesy.
You can click on this menu to see all the columns of your Taskesy file.
You can click on an existing column, then a "None" box will appear on that column.
Remember that if there's already a "None" box in that column, you won't be able to add another one. - Check the "Boxes" section to know more about box properties.

* Add Column:
You can click on this button to add one more column to your Taskesy file.

* Add Row
You can click on this button to add one more row to your Taskesy file.

* Delete:
On the Delete Menu, you can click to see the available options.
Click on the "Delete Column" button to delete the last column; remember that you will lose all the boxes contained in that column.
Click on the "Delete Row" button to delete the last row; remember that you will lose all the boxes contained on that row.

* Credits:
You can see the credits of the application.

* Performance:
To the right of the "Credits" menu, you can see the application's performance.

- Boxes:

* "None" Boxes:
This type of boxes behave like they are empty; this means you can't add more boxes to the same column, exchange this box, or save it in a file; you can't delete it individually either.
You can only mark it as completed.

* Non-empty Boxes:
Once you enter text on a "None" box, it becomes non-empty, and you can mark the box as completed, exchange it with other non-empty boxes, and read and save them into Taskesy files.
Once a box is non-empty, it can't be a "None" box again (you can still delete a non-empty box).

* General:
Right-click on a box to start an exchange with another non-empty box. Right-click on the first one and repeat the same to the one you want to do the exchange.
Left-click on a box to open its pop-up. You can read all the text it contains on the pop-up. You can change the box text or mark the box as completed.
